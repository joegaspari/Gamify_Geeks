# Gamify Geeks

Current e-learning platforms primarily focused around the computer science field lack focus around mastery learning. With the absence of repeatable content on these platforms, many learners both beginner and expert are left entering their next subject with only a fraction of the required knowledge to excel. The team’s gamified learning platform aims to solve this problem by integrating AI components to address the work-intensive nature of unique repeatable content. By addressing this issue, the team creates an e-learning platform revolving around the idea of mastery learning to continuously practice content until students are sufficiently confident or competent in the subject matter.

## About the project

The Gamified Coding Practice Application project, undertaken by Learnification Technologies, aims to help students learn and practice coding skills. By leveraging the power of modern technologies, personalization, and gamification, the application intends to create an engaging and efficient learning experience for students.

The primary objective of the project is to develop a dynamic web application that encourages students to practice coding by providing them with a gamified environment. The application will let students choose their preferred programming language to focus on, allowing them to tailor their learning experience according to their individual needs and interests.

To achieve this, the project will utilize React JS, a powerful JavaScript library. It will form the foundation of the application's front-end, ensuring a seamless and user-friendly interface for students. The core functionality of the Gamified Coding Practice Application will be built around Open AI’s APIs. It will generate coding questions tailored to the selected programming language.

The gamified nature of the application will enhance student engagement by incorporating elements such as badges, leaderboards, and rewards. By making coding practice enjoyable and interactive, the application will encourage students to dedicate more time and effort to their learning journey.

## Project purpose

To leverage the power of artificial intelligence (AI) in revolutionizing the way students learn to code. The project will create an interactive and immersive learning environment that empowers students to develop essential coding skills with ease and confidence. By harnessing the capabilities of AI, the project will provide personalized learning tailored to each student's unique needs, abilities and learning pace.

To enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of coding education by providing instructors with a comprehensive and customizable set of questions. The goal is to equip educators with the tools to seamlessly align coding assessments with their course curriculum, ensuring students are challenged appropriately while reinforcing key concepts. The project will harness AI to automate the process of generating coding questions, taking into account the desired learning outcomes, difficulty levels, and programming languages. The project aims to save instructors valuable time and effort by offering a diverse range of high-quality questions that cater to the specific needs of their students
