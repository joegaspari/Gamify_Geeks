# Gamify Geeks: Front End

## EsLinter

Welcome to our React front-end project! In this repository, we have integrated ESLinter, a powerful linting tool, to help enforce coding conventions, improve code quality, and catch potential errors in your JavaScript code

## ESLinter

> ESLinter is a widely used linting utility that analyzes your code for common mistakes, enforces coding styles, and identifies potential issues. By incorporating ESLinter into our project, we ensure consistent code style and improve overall code maintainability.

---

## Getting Started

To start using ESLinter in our React front-end project, enter this command into your terminal (note you must navigate to the client directory before running the command)

**Command**

`npm run lint`

This command will execute ESLinter and scan the src directory for linting errors based on the rules defined in our .eslintrc.json file.

This command will also automatically fix the fixable errors and update our code accordingly.

If any linting errors are found, ESLinter will output a list of error messages in the terminal. Review and fix the reported errors based on the provided feedback.

    By integrating ESLinter into our React front-end project, we can ensure consistent code style, improve code quality, and catch potential errors early in the development process. Regularly running ESLinter on our codebase will help us maintain a high level of code maintainability and adhere to best practices.
