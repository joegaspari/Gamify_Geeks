# Gamify Geeks: Back end

## EsLinter

Welcome to our Node JS backend project! In this repository, we have integrated ESLinter, a powerful linting tool, to help enforce coding conventions, improve code quality, and catch potential errors in your JavaScript code

## ESLinter 
>ESLinter is a widely used linting utility that analyzes your code for common mistakes, enforces coding styles, and identifies potential issues. By incorporating ESLinter into our project, we ensure consistent code style and improve overall code maintainability.

---
## Getting Started
To start using ESLinter in our Node JS backend project, enter this command into your terminal (note you must navigate to the server directory before running the command)

**Command**

`npm run lintFix`

This command will execute ESLinter and scan the src directory for linting errors based on the rules defined in our .eslintrc.json file.

This command will also automatically fix the fixable errors and update our code accordingly.

If any linting errors are found, ESLinter will output a list of error messages in the terminal. Review and fix the reported errors based on the provided feedback.

    By integrating ESLinter into our Node JS backend project, we can ensure consistent code style, improve code quality, and catch potential errors early in the development process. Regularly running ESLinter on our codebase will help us maintain a high level of code maintainability and adhere to best practices.

# Open AI API

The Open AI API will need to be implemented over a couple of files. The first file involves building a generate.js file which will be used to connect the node server to the API.
